        A magical and enchanting place, this romantic part of the park is home to a number of facilities designed by the
        engineer Blin: a river that you can cross over small bridges ending in a high romantic waterfall. There is also
        a grotto and a menagerie. This part of the park is called "Jardin des Catherinettes", named after the former
        hospice that used to be located here, welcoming socially disadvantaged women and children. This part of the park
        was built in the 20th century in response to the demands of the inhabitants of the bourgeois district of Le
        square de La Motte who wanted an opening onto the park. The Garden is located at the southern end of the garden,
        near the entrance to Rue de Paris.

        The Jardin des Catherinettes and its grotto are the perfect place to cool off in the summer, the shady area with
        its exotic trees, the trickling water of the river and the waterfall will bring you the coolness you are looking
        for.
