<h1>
    The Carré Duguesclin

        The Carré Du Guesclin was laid out in 1825.

        It is a trapezoidal lawn with a walkway bordered by an avenue of chestnut trees, regularly replanted for safety
        (falling trees) and aesthetic reasons (uniformity of the paths).

        On the short side, a stone arch highlighting a column of July allows to overhang the boulingrin. From this
        observatory, the observer has the impression that the du Guesclin square is parallelepipedic.

        A July column, designed by Jean-Baptiste Barré, was erected in 1835 in memory of two people from Rennes, Louis
        Vaneau, a polytechnician, and Papu, a surgeon and son of a dentist, who died in Paris in 1830 during the Three
        Glorious Years. The Vanneau-Papu column owes its erection to the poet Hippolyte Lucas who took it upon himself
        to move the population about the fate of the two Rennes citizens.

        This monument consists of a base and a column topped by a small statue representing Liberty.

        Finally, since 2016, the large and beautiful lawn of the Carré Du Guesclin has finally been authorized to the
        public.

        It was in a way the enigma of the Thabor.

        Indeed, with more than one and a half million visitors per year, to protect the lawn, the municipality had long
        prohibited access to this space yet tempting.

        Here, only a few events such as Mythos or Le Grand Soufflet could install their tent. But the municipality
        finally gave in, faced with the increase in the number of visitors to the green spaces, a news that had greatly
        delighted the inhabitants of the city of Rennes.
